Composipy Examples
===================

Composipy is very handy for performing exploratory analysis. It is built using the most powerful Python numerical libraries, so users can think of using Composipy in the same way as Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy. In fact, Composipy is built using their objects and structures.

Composipy is especially useful for leveraging the data-driven culture in companies and can be used to build response surfaces, generate samples, and much more. Find interesting Jupyter notebooks among the examples
